# Ogre

This gem supports organization and user management for Enterprise Chef.

While this functionality already exists in [knife-opc](https://github.com/chef/knife-opc), we wanted to be able to create the chef policy repository as well and set the private key into vCenter Orchestrator all in one tool.

## Installation

`gem install ogre`
